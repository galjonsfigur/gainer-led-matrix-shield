## GAINER LED Matrix shield PCB and schematics

[Shiled board](img/board.png "GAINER Led Matrix Shield")

A simple shield for GAINER I/O board to connect a 8x8 LED Matrix. Single-sided PCB designed in KiCad with large 1206 SMD components. Contents:

- `img/`: Folder with images of the board and connected LED Matrix.
- `schematics.pdf` - Connection diagram exported from KiCad.
- Rest of the files: KiCad design files.

#### Warning
There is a little error in design - spacing between pin headers of GAINER board is too small so female pin headers have to be bent to fit. This shouldn't be an issue if the board is manufactured in very small quantity.
